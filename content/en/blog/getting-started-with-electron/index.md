[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) is a framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. With electron you can use existing web development skills to create desktop applications.

Some of the most famous apps that have been made using electron are:

1. Visual Studio Code
2. Twitch
3. Microsoft Teams
4. Whatsapp Desktop

Since electron apps use HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you can also use various libraries such as React, Bootstrap, etc.

You can build beautiful looking apps using electron. Here is an app called [eDEX-UI](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui) which was built using electron.

To get started with electron you need to have basic web development skills. It also helps to have a basic understanding of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). You can read about that Node.js is from [here](https://nodejs.dev/learn).

You can start learning electron now by building a simple todo list application by going [here](/docs/todo-list-app-with-electron/installation-and-basic-setup/).

You can find the entire source code of the app in this [repository](https://github.com/code-explorer/Electron-Todo-List).
