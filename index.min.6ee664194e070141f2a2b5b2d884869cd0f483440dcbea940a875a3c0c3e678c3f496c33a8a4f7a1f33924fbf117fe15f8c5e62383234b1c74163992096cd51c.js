There are 2-ways in which you can store data to disk. Firstly, we can use a database. However, this involves complex setup and maintenance. The second way to do this is to store our data directly to a file.\nThe easiest way to do this is to use the electron-store package.\nInstalling the package # To install the electron-store package all we need to do is run the following command:\nnpm install electron-store  main.js vs index.js # You might have been wondering why we have 2 different script files (main.js and index.js).\nThe reason is that main.js is the main script that runs even when you have multiple windows but index.js runs only when the index.html page which it is connected to is loaded.\nSo, if we want to have data persistance, we need to do the file handling inside main.js and then send it to index.js to display it.\nStoring and retrieving data # Now that we have the electron-store package installed we can import and use it in our application.\nTo import the library add the following lines of code at the beginning of main.js:\nconst Store = require(\u0026quot;electron-store\u0026quot;);  Now let us create a variable from the Store class that we imported. Add the following lines below the code to import the library:\nconst store = new Store();  Finally, let us create functions for storing and retrieving todos.\n// Load todos from disk and if not todos exist then return a blank array function loadTodos() { return store.get(\u0026quot;todos\u0026quot;, []); } // Save the following todos function saveTodos(todos) { store.set(\u0026quot;todos\u0026quot;, todos); }  At this point you main.js should look like this:\n// Import from the electron library const { app, BrowserWindow } = require(\u0026quot;electron\u0026quot;); // Import electron store library const Store = require(\u0026quot;electron-store\u0026quot;); const store = new Store(); // Function to create a window function createWindow() { const win = new BrowserWindow({ width: 800, height: 600, }); // Load the html file inside the window win.loadFile(\u0026quot;index.html\u0026quot;); } // Create the window when the app is initialized app.whenReady().then(() =\u0026gt; { createWindow(); }); // Quit the app when the window is closed app.on(\u0026quot;window-all-closed\u0026quot;, () =\u0026gt; { app.quit(); }); // Load todos from disk and if not todos exist then return a blank array function loadTodos() { return store.get(\u0026quot;todos\u0026quot;, []); } // Save the following todos function saveTodos(todos) { store.set(\u0026quot;todos\u0026quot;, todos); }  Transferring data between main.js and index.js # At this point we have create function to store and retrieve data from disk. However, we have no way to send the retrieved data from main.js to index.js and updated data form index.js to main.js.\nBefore we do anything, we need to modify our createWindow() function to allow index.js to use node.js libraries. Update the createWindow() function to the following:\nfunction createWindow() { const win = new BrowserWindow({ width: 800, height: 600, webPreferences: { nodeIntegration: true, contextIsolation: false, }, }); // Load the html file inside the window win.loadFile(\u0026quot;index.html\u0026quot;); }  Import necessary libraries # Now that node.js libraries can be used inside all our script files we can import the necessary libraries.\nInside main.js modify\n// Import from the electron library const { app, BrowserWindow } = require(\u0026quot;electron\u0026quot;);  to\n// Import from the electron library const { app, BrowserWindow, webContents, ipcMain } = require(\u0026quot;electron\u0026quot;);  Inside index.js add the following line at the beginning:\nconst { ipcRenderer } = require(\u0026quot;electron\u0026quot;);  Sending todos from main.js to index.js # To load and send todos on app start, we have to modify our createWindow() function to the following:\nfunction createWindow() { const win = new BrowserWindow({ width: 800, height: 600, webPreferences: { nodeIntegration: true, contextIsolation: false, }, }); // Load the html file inside the window win.loadFile(\u0026quot;index.html\u0026quot;); // Send todos to index.html on the displayTodos channel win.webContents.on(\u0026quot;did-finish-load\u0026quot;, () =\u0026gt; { win.webContents.send(\u0026quot;displayTodos\u0026quot;, loadTodos()); }); }  Receiving todos from main.js # To receive the todos add the following line to index.js:\nipcRenderer.on(\u0026quot;displayTodos\u0026quot;, (event, todos) =\u0026gt; displayTodos(todos));  Sending updated todos from index.js # Since we are always going to call the displayTodos() function whenever our todos are updated we can add the following line to send the updated todos to main.js:\nipcRenderer.send(\u0026quot;updated-todos\u0026quot;, Todos);  Receiving updated todos from index.js # We can receive the updated todos from index.js and update our storage by adding the following to main.js:\nipcMain.on(\u0026quot;updated-todos\u0026quot;, (event, todos) =\u0026gt; { saveTodos(todos); });  Now our app can store our todos even after the app is closed.\nHowever there is one final thing we need to do which is to update the todo whenever a checkbox is clicked. We have already given a unique id to each checkbox so all we need to do is update the todos whenever the checkbox is clicked.\nFirst let us create a function inside index.js which toggles our todos inside the variable where we store all our todos.\nfunction toggleTodo(i) { Todos[i].Done = !Todos[i].Done; displayTodos(Todos); }  Next let us update our displayTodos() function to add event listeners to all our checkboxes:\nfunction displayTodos(todos) { // Get the div inside which we are going to store the todos todosHTML = document.getElementById(\u0026quot;todos\u0026quot;); // Clear the contents of the div todosHTML.innerHTML = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; let i = 0; todos.forEach((todo) =\u0026gt; { todosHTML.innerHTML += '\u0026lt;input type=\u0026quot;checkbox\u0026quot; id=\u0026quot;todo-check-' + i + '\u0026quot;' + (todo.Done ?

Let us change our displayTodos() function like so:\nfunction displayTodos(todos) { // Get the div inside which we are going to store the todos todosHTML = document.getElementById(\u0026quot;todos\u0026quot;); // Clear the contents of the div todosHTML.innerHTML = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;; let i = 0; todos.forEach((todo) =\u0026gt; { todosHTML.innerHTML += '\u0026lt;label class=\u0026quot;list-group-item d-flex gap-3 todo-checkbox\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;input class=\u0026quot;form-check-input flex-shrink-0\u0026quot; type=\u0026quot;checkbox\u0026quot; id=\u0026quot;todo-check-' + i + '\u0026quot;' + (todo.Done ? \u0026quot;checked\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;\u0026quot;) + '\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;pt-1 form-checked-content\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;' + todo.Description + \u0026quot;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/label\u0026gt;\u0026quot;; i++; }); ipcRenderer.send(\u0026quot;updated-todos\u0026quot;, Todos); for (let i = 0; i \u0026lt; Todos.length; i++) { document .getElementById(\u0026quot;todo-check-\u0026quot; + i) .addEventListener(\u0026quot;change\u0026quot;, () =\u0026gt; toggleTodo(i)); } }  At the end of this you should have an app that looks like this:   "}).add({id:13,href:"/docs/todo-list-app-with-electron/packaging-application/",title:"Packaging Application",description:"In order to package and distribute your electron application, you can use Electron Forge.\nInstalling Electron Forge # Run the following command to install electron forge:\nnpm install --save-dev @electron-forge/cli npx electron-forge import  Package Application # To build your application for distribution, run the command:\nnpm run make  This will create a folder called out which contains your application ready for distribution.",content:"In order to package and distribute your electron application, you can use Electron Forge.\nInstalling Electron Forge # Run the following command to install electron forge:\nnpm install --save-dev @electron-forge/cli npx electron-forge import  Package Application # To build your application for distribution, run the command:\nnpm run make  This will create a folder called out which contains your application ready for distribution.\n"}).add({id:14,href:"/docs/intro-to-git-and-github/",title:"Intro to Git and Github",description:"",content:""}).add({id:15,href:"/docs/",title:"Docs",description:"Resources",content:""}),search.addEventListener('input',b,!0);function b(){var b,e;const d=5;b=this.value,e=a.search(b,{limit:d,enrich:!0});const c=new Map;for(const a of e.flatMap(a=>a.result)){if(c.has(a.doc.href))continue;c.set(a.doc.href,a.doc)}if(suggestions.innerHTML="",suggestions.classList.remove('d-none'),c.size===0&&b){const a=document.createElement('div');a.innerHTML=`No results for "<strong>${b}</strong>"`,a.classList.add("suggestion__no-results"),suggestions.appendChild(a);return}for(const[h,g]of c){const b=document.createElement('div');suggestions.appendChild(b);const a=document.createElement('a');a.href=h,b.appendChild(a);const e=document.createElement('span');e.textContent=g.title,e.classList.add("suggestion__title"),a.appendChild(e);const f=document.createElement('span');if(f.textContent=g.description,f.classList.add("suggestion__description"),a.appendChild(f),suggestions.appendChild(b),suggestions.childElementCount==d)break}}})()
